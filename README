Shikai 0.1
Shikai is a HTTPS proxy that monitors server certificates at the
beginning of the HTTPS communication. It allows only these connections
to servers, which has trusted certificate.

Currently program can maintain a list of SHA-256 hashes of trusted
certificates or communicate with Perspectives Project servers.
If a certificate, that is sent by server through proxy connection
is listed in database, the connection is continued or rejected if isn't.

Requirements:
- Python 2.5+
- python-twisted module

Configuration:
The program configuration is stored in config/shikai_config file.
Perspectives Project servers list is located in
config/perspectives_notary_list.txt.

Configuration of local database of trusted certificates:
At the beginning certifications should be added to the database.
In order to do that run the program and connect to some sites -
before that try to make sure that you are no under MitM attack
- when you visit a site, Shikai will add the certificate
to the list of secure certificates.
After that process, change allowmode in config/shikai_config to 0.

Running:
twisted -ny shikai.py to see log on a terminal or
twisted -y shikai.py [-l log.log] to run program as a deamon (-l
specifies a file to log, default it's twistd.log)
In web browser preferences set SSL proxy to your Shikai process
(default 127.0.0.1:8080).
For example in Opera it can be changed in Preferences(Ctrl+F12)->
Advanced->Network->Proxy Servers...->HTTPS.

The program was tested and works with Mozilla Firefox 6.0.2,
Opera 11.52, Google Chrome 13, M$ IE 9 and should work with some other web
browsers.
