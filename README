Shikai 0.2
Shikai is a HTTPS proxy that monitors server certificates at the
beginning of the HTTPS communication. It allows only these connections
to servers, which has trusted certificate.

Currently program can communicate with Perspectives Project servers or 
with Convergence servers.
If a certificate, that is sent by server through proxy connection
is listed in database, the connection is continued or rejected if isn't.

Requirements:
- Python 2.5+
- python-twisted module

Configuration:
The program configuration is stored in config/shikai_config file.
Perspectives Project servers list is located in
config/perspectives_notary_list.txt.
Convergence notaries with SHA-1 hashes of their certificates are stored
in config/convergence_notary_list.txt file.

Running:
twisted -ny shikai.py to see log on a terminal or
twisted -y shikai.py [-l log.log] to run program as a deamon (-l
specifies a file to log, default it's twistd.log)
In web browser preferences set SSL proxy to your Shikai process
